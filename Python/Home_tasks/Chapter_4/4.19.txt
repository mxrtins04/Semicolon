-It encourages declarative style, where you specify the goal without worrying about the low-level details of how it's accomplished.

-It enables better composability, reusability, and parallelism.

-"What" programming is made feasible by higher-order functions, immutable data structures, abstraction layers, and functional paradigms that allow you to express computations without worrying about the step-by-step implementation
